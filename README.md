# House_Price_Prediction
This project predicts house prices based on the location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. It is designed to help real estate agents and homeowners get an accurate estimate of a property's value. The frontend was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the backend was developed using Python.
